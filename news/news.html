        <h2>Who’ll guarantee safety of kids in Manipur schools?</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\paras\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStackProject\news\Screenshot 2023-07-07 213326.png">
        <p><b>Woman killed outside school</b><br>
            Unidentified gunmen shot dead a middle-aged woman outside a school in Manipur’s Imphal West district on Thursday, PTI news agency reported, a day after the state government ordered reopening of educational institutions in the violence-hit state after two months.
            <br><b>A scary situation</b><br>
            While the first day recorded low attendance in all the districts, parents seemed to be scared of sending their children to schools even on Thursday due to the continuing violence and arson.
            A school principal told TOI that guardians were not willing to send their kids to school before normalcy returns. Classes from 1 to 8 resumed on Wednesday.
            <br><b>A ghastly incident</b><br>
            About 35 km away from Imphal, a large number of people protested at the Sekmaijin Bazar bridge, blocking the road in Kakching district after videos of two youths killed by militants went viral on Wednesday night.
            The videos showed two missing youths being tortured before they were shot by suspected militants and their bodies kicked into a pit.
            Protesters demanded Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh and the deputy commissioner to use all resources to locate the remains of the two youths within three days, so their families could perform their last rites.
            <br><b>Gunfights continue</b><br>
            Intermittent gunfire was heard in a village in Manipur's Kangpokpi district early Thursday, hours after security forces thwarted clashes when men armed with automatic weapons began to attack villagers.
            <br><b>Kukis protest</b><br>
            In Churachandpur, about 100 km away, a large number of Kukis staged a protest on Wednesday.
            Nearly 4,000 people participated in the rally. Some of them were reportedly dressed in “combat” outfits with camouflage on their faces.
            <br><b>A walkout</b><br>
            Three opposition members, two from the Congress and one from Trinamool Congress, on Thursday walked out of a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs, after their demand to hold an unscheduled discussion on the Manipur situation was turned down by the committee chairman Brijlal.</p>

        <h2>Why Sena sees discontent when Pawars are fighting</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\paras\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStackProject\news\Screenshot 2023-07-07 213406.png">
        <br><p><br><b>Discontent in Sena</b><br>
            Even as Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde affirmed there was no trouble within his Shiv Sena over the entry of NCP leader Ajit Pawar as deputy CM in the government, rumblings within the CM’s camp grew on Thursday.
            Independent MLA Bachchu Kadu, a Shinde camp follower, said the 40 original rebel Sena MLAs feel that the rebellion was all a mistake and that Ajit Pawar’s entry would pose problems.
            Two Shiv Sena MLAs, Bharat Gogawale and Mahendra Thorve opposed the possible appointment of NCP’s Aditi Tatkare as guardian minister of Raigad district.
            Over the past three days, some Sena ministers and MLAs have expressed their discomfort at the new political arrangement in Maharashtra.
            <b><br>But a denial</b><br>
            Shinde, however, said, “There is no problem with Ajit Pawar’s entry. It has made our government stronger. All of us believe in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision.”
            On the likelihood of seat-sharing issues in future, Shinde said, “Those who have won seats will retain them. The rest will be shared amicably.”
            <br><b>‘No resignation’<br></b>
            Shinde dismissed “rumours” that he would resign, saying, “All kinds of stories are being spread. The Shiv Sena (UBT)’s own house is falling apart, and they are making allegations about others.”
            <br><b>A ‘revolt’ claim</b><br>
            Meanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Vinayak Raut claimed that 8-10 MLAs from Shinde camp were in touch with Uddhav Thackeray after Ajit Pawar joined the government.
            The group’s Sanjay Raut said the Shinde camp now belonged nowhere.
           <br><b>A national executive</b><br>
            Meanwhile, NCP founder Sharad Pawar called a national executive meeting in Delhi, asserting he is the president of the party and “will continue to work effectively whether 82 or 92”.
            At the Delhi meeting, Sharad Pawar expelled MP Praful Patel and other rebels from the party.
            Ajit Pawar took strong objection to the national executive convened by Sharad Pawar, dubbing it illegal and with no legal sanctity. </p>

        <h2>Under pressure, Trudeau says Canada ‘always against terror’</h2 >
        <img src="C:\Users\paras\OneDrive\Desktop\FullStackProject\news\Screenshot 2023-07-07 213457.png">
        <br><p><b>What</b><br>
            Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said that his country has “always taken serious action against terrorism and we always will” in reaction to allegations that the Canadian government is soft and reluctant to act against pro-Khalistan gatherings and terrorists in the country.
            Calling Canada an “extremely diverse country,” Trudeau said on Thursday that his country will make sure that violence and extremism are pushed back in all its forms.
            <br><b>Friction in ties</b><br>
            Trudeau’s statement comes after India summoned the Canadian High Commissioner in New Delhi over propaganda material, including posters, containing threats to Indian diplomats being circulated in Canada by pro-Khalistan groups.
            India has been asking Canada not to give space to pro-Khalistan separatists and extremists elements for a while.
            Last week, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that Canada’s response to the Khalistani issue appeared to be constrained by its “vote bank compulsions”, adding that the Khalistan issue has impacted the ties between the two countries in many ways.
            Last month, India slammed Canada after visuals surfaced on social media of a float in Brampton that reportedly celebrated the assassination of former prime minister Indira Gandhi.
            <br><b>What MEA says<br></b>
            India’s Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday called the recent events in Canada “unacceptable”, which India condemns in the strongest terms.
            “We have called on the government of Canada to take all steps to ensure the safety of our diplomats and security of our diplomatic missions in Canada,” said spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, adding that it is a matter of concern that freedom of expression and speech is once again being misused by the anti-India elements based in Canada.
            <b><br>Also<br></b>
            UK foreign secretary James Cleverly has warned against violence being used against the Indian high commission in London or its staff during any protest following a TOI report on alarming posters being shared online inciting violence against two Indian senior diplomats in Britain and calling for a “Kill India” Khalistan rally outside the London mission on July 8.What
